# alter

alter is a human connection platform that employs the major
planetary positions of a userâ€™s western astrological natal chart
as a basis for relational curation. By analyzing user-provided
birth information, alter generates a profile that assings each
of the system's eleven primary celestial bodies one of 12 possible positions. These paired elements, of what is
traditionally refered to as a user's birth chart, then allow the
user to narrow their exposure to other members of the network by
filtering them through their preferred partner configurations.
This differentiates each user as 1 in 12 to the 11th power or 1
in 743 billion possible profile configurations, equipping every
user with just one more tool in the process toward willfull
relational pairing.

Once preferences are submitted, you are redirected to a home page now populated with user matches that correspond with your preferences. The home page shows users' major planet positions, their level of alignment with your preferences and bios. From there you can click on individual profiles to learn more or message them.
